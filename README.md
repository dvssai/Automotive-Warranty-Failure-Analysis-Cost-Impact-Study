x# Automotive Warranty Failure Analysis

This project analyzes 100 automotive warranty repair cases to identify failure patterns, cost drivers, and quality issues, with a primary focus on steering wheel-related claims.

## Key Findings
- **78%** of repairs resulted in full steering wheel replacement → indicates **design or supplier quality leakage**.
- **Full-Size Truck platform** accounts for **52%** of affected vehicles → high financial exposure.
- **Average repair cost:** $531 per case → Sample = **$53,100+** cost burn.
- **25% of failures occur within 6 months** → early-life failures impacting customer satisfaction.
- Complaint text categorized into:
  - Material Damage
  - Heating Failure
  - Driver Assist Issues
  - Horn Switch Failures
  - Steering Noise

## Business Impact
Unnecessary steering wheel replacements drive cost, delay service times, and damage perceived vehicle quality. Early failure patterns suggest process or material control issues, not user behavior.

## Recommendations
- **Immediate:** Audit steering wheel supplier quality.
- **Short-Term:** Tighten adhesive, stitching, and trim material validation at key plants.
- **Mid-Term:** Review heated steering module design for reliability under varying use conditions.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
